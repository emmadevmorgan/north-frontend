3.  Explore different chart types and hover over data points for insights.
    

🏗️ Future Enhancements
-----------------------

*   Scale the application to handle increased **product data** if production expands to 10+ products.
    
*   Improve **mobile responsiveness** to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
    
*   Implement **unit and integration tests** for better reliability and maintainability.
    
*   **Dockerize** the application for easier deployment and scalability.
    
*   Introduce **Redux for state management** to handle complex state updates efficiently when scaling.

*   Enforce ESLint for consistent code quality and best practices.

*   Toastr for displaying successful operations and error handlings.


Implementation Assumptions
-----------------------
    
*   The current solution has been developed with the assumption that the API provides data for **four products**. If the number of products increases significantly, further optimizations may be required.
